                <h1 class="index-p">Early and personal life</h1>
                <p class="index-p lil-p">Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre,
                    the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. His mother, Miguelina Elói Assis dos Santos,
                    was a salesperson who studied to become a nurse. His father, João de Assis Moreira, was a shipyard
                    worker and a footballer for the local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with the
                    larger
                    Cruzeiro Esporte Clube). After Ronaldo's older brother Roberto signed with Grêmio, the family moved
                    to a home in the more affluent Guarujá section of Porto Alegre, which was a gift from Grêmio to
                    convince
                    Roberto to stay at the club. Still, Roberto's career was ultimately cut short by injury. It was in
                    their
                    new home where his father hit his head and drowned in the swimming pool when Ronaldo was eight.
                    Today,
                    Roberto acts as his manager, while his sister Deisi works as his press coordinator.
