## Features left to Implement
- A search button with a magnifying glass icon that will redirect to any part of the website.

## Testing

- I built this website for PC first before media queries for mobile responsiveness. The majorities of the issues appeared with the dropdown menu.<br>
The dropdown menu was coded to work on the following:<br>
An opacity and transform animation that transitioned into the dropdown menu to appear. Frst thing I weanted to fix was that the dropdown menu wouldn't disappear when the button was clicked again so I used a pointer-events workarout for that.
- Second major issue was that this dropdown menu wasn't working on touchscreens, the links wouldn't direct to other pages likes it worked o PC.
So after a lot of testing, I decided to redo a whole new dropdown menu only for touchcreens using @media(pointer:course), which instead of a button it consists of a hidden checkbox input that looks like a button.
- I also created another media query for the website to work on mobile with good resizing.

- The website passed within the following validating websites:
    <br>HTML
